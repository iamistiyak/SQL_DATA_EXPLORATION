# SQL_DATA_EXPLORATION
**Description:** I have used this Covid-19 data set for exploration purposes.<br><br>
**Prerequisite:** SQL Server(Version:Developer), SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for frontend, for import pupose I have used import export wizard [Version: SQL Server 2022 Import and Export Data(64-bit)].<br><br>
I have divided this dataset into the 2 different excel files 1)CovidDeaths 2)CovidVaccinations in these files I have used perticular few columns for getting the insights.<br><br>
I got these insights from this excel dataset.<br><br>
| **Explorations** |
| :---: |
| Show the covid vaccinations data |
| Looking for howmany percent population got affected  |
| Looking for howmany percent population got affected in perticular country[Like: India, UK etc..] |
| Looking for countries who were highly affected |
| Looking for highest death count per population in different location |
| Breakdown total death count for continent |
| Global death percentage |
| Total Population vs Vaccination |<br><br><br><br>

I have used this command for fulfil the above purposes.
| Command | Description |
| :--- | --- |
| MAX | Get the maximum value from the column |
| SUM | Get sum of the column values |
| CONVERT | Change the data type of the column values |
| CAST | Change the data type of the column values |
| JOIN | Join the tables |
| WHERE | For the implementing the condition|
| COUNT | Count the column values|
| GROUP BY | Grouping the column values to get overall insights |
| ORDER BY | Can sort the table according to the the column values |
| PARTITION BY | Get the sum of the group and put the same values for each group in different column |
| CTE | Calculate the percentage of new vaccine takers |
| TEMP TABLE | Calculate the percentage of new vaccine takers |
| INSERT INTO | Insert the values in the table |
| DATA TYPES | nvarchar(255)-Strings, numerics - integers,flot etc.., datetime - Date | <br><br><br><br>
| DECIMAL(15,3) |  Means the value can have 3 digits overall and 2 digits to the right of the decimal point |
